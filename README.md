## 📜 Creation Manifesto

*PiTriade* is an original creation designed to ritualize redistribution within the Pi ecosystem.  
Each cycle of 10 purchases becomes a living sequence of recognition:

- **Merit** — the dominant player  
- **Chance** — the bonus draw  
- **Loyalty** — the most active player

This triadic structure honors effort, presence, and participation.

## 🌀 Redistribution Structure

| Role                  | Percentage | Activation Moment         |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Main winner           | 44%        | At the 10th purchase       |
| Bonus draw            | 44%        | Immediately after          |
| 9 other players       | 1.11% each | Automatic                  |
| Creator               | 1%         | At each completed series   |
| Loyalty reward        | 1%         | After the bonus draw       |

## 🌍 Purpose

*PiTriade* is designed to be:

- **Multilingual** — accessible to a global audience  
- **Mobile-friendly** — optimized for Pi Browser and mobile devices  
- **Visible in the Pi Directory** — discoverable by the Pi community

Each series is a threshold of activation. Each redistribution is an act of recognition.

## 🧠 Prompt for Pi App Studio

> I want to create a Web3 application named **PiTriade**, where each player purchases a “PI token” for a fixed amount.  
> Every 10th purchase triggers a redistribution:  
> • The player with the most tokens among the 10 receives **44%** of the pool.  
> • The other 9 players each receive **1.11%**.  
> • **1%** goes to my wallet as the creator.  
> • **44%** is allocated to a **bonus pool**, awarded by random draw among the 9 others.  
> • **1%** is allocated to a **loyalty pool**, awarded to the most active player across recent series.  
>
> The app must:  
> • Connect to **Pi Wallet** for payments  
> • **Automate reward distribution**  
> • Display **active series**, **winners**, **loyalty stats**, and **participation history**  
> • Be **simple**, **mobile-friendly**, **multilingual**, and **visible in the Pi Directory**
